# NetworkAnalysisTasks: Introduction/Overview

   This project maintains a list of network analysis tasks we have collected over time that represent challenging scenarios for network professionals, especially when trying to solve with the current set of network traffic and packet analysis tools, like Wireshark. 

   We encourage you to try and solve these and let us know how you did it.

   Also, if you have scenarios and stumpers that you would like to submit for inclusion, please raise an new issue in Github or submit them to us directly at info@capstarforensics.com.

    It is our goal to create a growing list of challenging scenarios so that we can focus our energies on solving them in the most efficient way possible.

   We look forward to hearing from you.
